I have removed all third-party trackers from your `public/index.html` file, as you requested. Specifically, I have removed the scripts and links related to:

*   Font Awesome
*   Adobe Fonts (Typekit)
*   Google Analytics

These changes have been committed. You can now push the latest commit to your repository to deploy the updated version of your website without these trackers.

This completes the task of removing external trackers. If you have any other requests, feel free to ask.
