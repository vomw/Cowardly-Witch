I have successfully downloaded and installed Font Awesome locally. The necessary files have been added to the `public/vendor/fontawesome` directory, and the `index.html` file has been updated to use the local stylesheet.

This should restore the icons that disappeared after we removed the third-party trackers.

All tasks are now complete. You can push the latest commits to your repository to deploy the updated version of your website.

I am now ready for your next request.
